	<h1>SHARK</h1>
	<p>
		SHARK is an intelligent material handling system with special focus on automated storage 
		and retrieval equipment. It is a scalable and flexible solution, which can be used for any 
		installation from a small single computer installation to a large multi-server site with a 
		large number of clients. SHARK provides a modulized design and thereby easy to adapt to the 
		requested solution. This brochure defines the standard features, which can be extended by 
		additional modules or customized functionality.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		SHARK is designed from the idea that huge saving in cost and time can be achieved by optimizing 
		the performance of the warehouse by minimizing the manual work that has to be done, this by finding 
		optimal storage locations for each article, by controlling the sequence of orders to pick and by 
		supporting advanced equipment that improves the speed. To achieve this SHARK is based on advanced 
		algorithms that optimize location usages, picking speed and space utilization, all hidden for the 
		normal user but still working to improve the working speed. Another important issue is the quality 
		of the warehouse operations, it is expensive to pick the wrong article and therefore SHARK supports 
		control functions, barcodes in all areas, pick-to-light systems and other techniques that ensures 
		the right article at the right place.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Advanced functionality is fine, but not if it requires special training to make use of it. SHARK is 
		very easy to use for the normal operator, fast to learn and with intuitive functionality, so new 
		operators can be trained to the system with a short introduction. 
	</p>
	
	<p>	
		Shark divides the warehouse into some basic modules that are closely related to the various jobs that 
		have to be done in the warehouse.
