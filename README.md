### What is this repository for? ###

* Examples and experiments for learning enough Servlet and JSP to pass the SCWCD test
* Experiments, demonstrations, etc. with api's, technologies and other issues in the Servlet JSP domain

### How do I get set up? ###

* You'll obviously need Java - I recently started using jdk version 1.7.0_71. Most examples are configured to use version 1.5 or 1.6
* Most examples are Maven 2/3 based, a few uses gradle, so you'll definately need latest maven version, and latest gradle version.
* A few experiments use Ant for creating, starting, populating databases, som youll probably need that too.
* Most projects doesn't rely on any specific IDE. Eventhough i mostly use Eclipse, maven or gradle buildfiles should be able to be used as is, or as basis for generated project files
* A few projects use databases, Sql Server express is my preferred "heavy duty" RDBMS - some experiments use HSQLDB in various versions. Sql Server must be set up by hand - HSQLDB
* Database configuration
* How to run tests
* Deployment instructions
